Given an encoded string s, decode it by expanding the pattern k[substring], where the substring inside brackets is written k times. k is guaranteed to be a positive integer, and encodedString contains only lowercase english alphabets. Return the final decoded string.

Note: The test cases are generated so that the length of the output string will never exceed 10^5 .
