You are given an integer array arr[], the task is to find the maximum of minimum values for every window size k where 1≤ k ≤ arr.size().

For each window size k, consider all contiguous subarrays of length k, determine the minimum element in each subarray, and then take the maximum among all these minimums.

Return the results as an array, where the element at index i represents the answer for window size i+1.
