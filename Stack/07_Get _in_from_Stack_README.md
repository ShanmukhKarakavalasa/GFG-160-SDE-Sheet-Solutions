Implement a class SpecialStack that supports following operations:


push(x) – Insert an integer x into the stack.


pop() – Remove the top element from the stack.


peek() – Return the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.


getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element from the stack in O(1) time. If the stack is empty, return -1.


isEmpty() –  Return true if stack is empty, else false


There will be a sequence of queries queries[][]. The queries are represented in numeric form:


1 x : Call push(x)


2:  Call pop()


3: Call peek()


4: Call getMin()


5: Call isEmpty()
