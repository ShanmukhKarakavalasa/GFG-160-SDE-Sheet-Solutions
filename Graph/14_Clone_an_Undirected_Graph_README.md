Given a connected undirected graph represented by adjacency list, adjList[][] with n nodes, having a distinct label from 0 to n-1, where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i.

Create a clone of the graph, where each node in the graph contains an integer val and an array (neighbors) of nodes, containing nodes that are adjacent to the current node.

Your task is to complete the function cloneGraph( ) which takes a starting node of the graph as input and returns the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.
