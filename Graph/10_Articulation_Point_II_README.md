You are given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges. The graph is represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each element edges[i] = [u, v] indicates an undirected edge between vertices u and v.
Your task is to return all the articulation points (or cut vertices) in the graph.
An articulation point is a vertex whose removal, along with all its connected edges, increases the number of connected components in the graph.
