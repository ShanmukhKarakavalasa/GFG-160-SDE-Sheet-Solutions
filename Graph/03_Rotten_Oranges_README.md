Given a matrix mat[][], where each cell in the matrix can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:
0 : Empty cell
1 : Cell have fresh oranges
2 : Cell have rotten oranges

Your task is to determine the minimum time required so that all the oranges become rotten. A rotten orange at index (i, j) can rot other fresh orange at indexes (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1) (up, down, left and right) in a unit time.
