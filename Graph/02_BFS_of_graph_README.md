Given a connected undirected graph containing V vertices, represented by a 2-d adjacency list adj[][], where each adj[i] represents the list of vertices connected to vertex i. Perform a Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal starting from vertex 0, visiting vertices from left to right according to the given adjacency list, and return a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph.
