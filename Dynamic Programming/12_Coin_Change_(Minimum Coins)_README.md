You are given an array coins[], where each element represents a coin of a different denomination, and a target value sum. You have an unlimited supply of each coin type {coins1, coins2, ..., coinsm}.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to obtain the target sum. If it is not possible to form the sum using the given coins, return -1.
