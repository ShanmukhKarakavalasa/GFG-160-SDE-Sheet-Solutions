Given an array arr[] and a number target, find a pair of elements (a, b) in arr[], where a â‰¤ b whose sum is closest to target.
Note: Return the pair in sorted order and if there are multiple such pairs return the pair with maximum absolute difference. If no such pair exists return an empty array.
